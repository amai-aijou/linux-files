# C Cheatsheet
#

C programs rely on three key features:

  1. "Directives"		Editing commands that modify the program prior to compilation (#include statements)
  2. "Functions"		Named blocks of executable code (main)
  3. "Statements"		Commands to be performed when program is run

Variable declarations can be combined:

  int height, length, width, volume; //a whole-number integer up to 2.1 billion
  float profit, loss: 				 //supports decimel point, but float may contain rounding errors!

Declarations must come before Statements; however, C99 allows them to be mixed up (like modern programming)
Append the letter f to Float numbers, i.e: profit = 2150.48f;


Providing a value to a variable for the first time is called an "initializer"; multiple variables may be declared
initializers only apply to one variable (int height, length = 10; does not work)
int height = 8, length = 12, width = 10;

"Wherever a value is needed, any expression of the same type will do."
-C General Principle

"printf" = print formatted (cout)
"scanf"  = read  formatted (cin)
  ("%d", &someVar); 

"Macro Definition": used to name constants; can be an expression
	#define INCHES_PER_POUND 166
	#definte RECIPROCAL_OF_PI (1.0f / 3.14159f)

C will truncate the result when two integers are divided. use float instead:
5.0f / 9.0f

"Identifier"	Variables, functions, macros, etc. 
				Case Sensitive.May contain letters, digits, underscores.
				Must begin with a letter or underscore* 
				*C99 allows for certain universal char. names
				best_practice, alsoBestPractice

C is built on "tokens": groups of chars that can't be split up without changing their meaning
  The following statement has seven tokens, separated by tabs: 
    printf	(	"Height: %d\n"	,	height	)	;

 "Chapter 3 - Formatted Input/Output"
#####################################

"conversion specification"	placeholder representing a value to be filled during print, ie %d
	"%d"   = integer (Decimel base 10)
	"%.1f" = float (display 1 decimel point)
	"%e"   = scientific notation (Exponential format)
	"%s"   = string

	"%m.pX / %-m.pX" (m and p are integer constants and X is a letter)
		"m - minimum field width" 	minimum amount to print
				%3d: "123", " 12", "12345" | %-3d: "123", "12 ", "12345"
		"p - precision"		minimum digits/decimel points to display
				%d = %.1d; %.2d: 22; %.3d: 022;			
				%g: displays a float in either %e or Fixed Decimel, depending on size
					p indicates max number of significant digits to display
				    doesn't show trailing zeros.  will drop decimel point if blank
					dynamic, switches from fixed decimel to exponential when necessary
		"X - conversion specifier"		type: %d, %e, %s, etc. (see above)

"Escape Sequences"
	\a Alert \b Backspace \n New line \t Horizontal Tab \" quotation mark
	%%: prints percent sign

"Scanf under the hood"
	Scanf will initially ignore whitespace/linebreaks during first format string match.
    After first match, it willl continue reading until it reads the first character inconsistent with
    the search string. It is here that whitespace begins to matter, as it is a non-digit character.
    Scanf then drops that from the string, and will add it to the *next* search (very important).
    A second search could attempt to start with an incorrect character if "4abc" is entered as an "int"

	"%d/%d"
	*5/*96 input (* is space) matches 5 to the first. it then drops the slash, uses it in its next match,
	which is a /, so it can continue, then stops at *. it starts at * again, drops the *, and matches 96
	
	*5*/*96 input would match 5 to the first, drop the space...then attempt to match the space to the 
	slash. Unlike conversion specifiers, which ignore beginning whitespace, this would not match, so
	it gets put back. then, */*96 gets run through the second %d, creating bad data. 

	Note: if the second format string was not /, scanf would still start the next match with /, which 
	would generate an error!
 	

#####################################
     "Chapter 4 - Expressions"
#####################################

"Expressions" Formulas that show how to compute a value
	variables, constants. both "b" and "b*c" are expressions
"Operators"
	/: when both operands are integers, fractions are truncated. 2/1=0, not 1
	%: modulo operator only works with integers
	Don't cross the streams...or use zero as the right operator (2/0, 2%0)
	"C89": -7/9 might be -1 or -2. -9%7 might be -2 or 5. Strange behavior
	"C99": Always truncates and rounds down (always -1). More standardized

"Implementation-Defined Behavior"
	C deliberately leaves parts of the language unspecified and allows the implementation - the software
		that allows it to compile and run - to specify behavior. One of C's goals is efficiency, which means
		matching the way the hardware behaves. Make programs agnostic whenver possible to prevent issues!
	
	C89: If either integer is negative, the result may be rounded up OR rounded down in C89, depending on implementation.
	C99: The integer will always be rounded down.	
Older Compilers are sometimes limited to 32,767 for an Integer. Use Scanf("%1d%1d") to read numbers one at a time

"Simple Assignment"
	v=e, where e becomes type v. An easy example:

	int i;
	float f;
	i = 72.99f	//i is now 72
	f = 136;	//f is now 136.0
	f = i = 33.f; //f is now 33.
	
	i = 1;
	k = 1 + (j = i); //not recommended, but valid. j=1, 1+1, k = 2;

"lvalue"
	Represents an object stored in computer memory, not a constant or result of a computation.
	Variables are l-values. Expressions are not.
	Assignment operator requires an lvalue 

"Compound Assignments"
	i += 2; //same as i = i + 2;
	Adds the value of the right operand to the variable on the left.
	-=	*=	/=	%=
	i += j += k; //this means i += (j += k)

"Increment/Decrement Operators"
	++i (prefix) and i++ (postfix) are Increment; --i/i-- are Decrement.
	Have higher precedence than unary plus/minus, and are left-associative.	
	printf("i is %d\n", ++i);	//prints "i is 2"
	printf("i is %d\n", i++);	//prints "i is 1", then increments to 2 *after*

Avoid "undefined behavior" by separating statements that may be evaluated different ways
	i = 2;
	j = i * i++;	//will i or i++ be evaluated before? 
	C doesn't define this, it all depends on the compiler!

"Fetching" a variable mean retrieving it's value from memory. A later change will not
	affect the fetched value, which is typically stored in the "register" in the CPU

C allows *any* expression to be used as a statement if you append a semi-colon.
	during i++; the statement executes, and the new value is fetched. its value is discarded,
	though that new value remains permanent as it will be fetched from memory.


#####################################
 "Chapter 5 - Selection Statements"
#####################################

"Selection Statements" 	#if, switch
	Allow a program to select a particular execution path from a set of alternatives
"Iteration Statements" 	#while, do, for
	Support iteration (looping)
"Jump statements" 		#break, continue, goto, return
	Cause an unconditional jump to some other place in the program
"Compound statement"	#else (see Chapter 6 for more)
	Groups several statements into a single statement
"Null Statement"		#empty semi-solon (;)
	Performs no action

"Relational and Equiality operators" 
	always return integer values: 0 (false), or 1 (true)

	(i >=j) + (i ==j)
		is equal to 0, 1, or 2, depending on whether i is less than,
			greater than, or equal to j. this isn't recommended however as it makes
			programs hard to understand

"Logical Operators"
	!	logical negation
	&&	logical and
	||	logical or

!exp: 			has the value 1 if expr has the value 0
exp1 && exp2: 	has the value 1 if the values are both non-zero.
exp1 || exp2:	has the value 1 if either (or both) has a non-zero value
	*In all other cases, these operators produce 0*

&&/||: if left is non-zero, they will "short-circuit"
	Neither will look at the right operators. && will be marked false, || true
	i > 0 && ++j > 0 will not increment j if i=0

"else" executes only when the "if" expression is 0 (aka not true)

"Conditional Expressions"
	expr1 ? expr2 : expr3

	Considered a ternary operator, evaluated as "if ? then : else"
	Parenthesis are often needed to prevent additional expressions being added by mistake
	i.e. k = (i >= 0 ? i : 0) + j;

	Tempting to use them to reduce returns or else statements:
	if (i > j )
		printf("%d\n", i);
	else
		printf("%d\n", j);
	#is equal to:
	printf("%d\n", i > j ? i : j);

"C89 Boolean (or lack thereof)"
	C89 lacks Boolean value. you can create an int variable and flag it 0 or 1
	Better yet, use macro definitions. BOOL will just translate to int:
	#define TRUE  1
	#define FALSE 0
	#define BOOL int
	BOOL flag = FALSE;
	if (flag == TRUE)

"C99 Boolean"
	Included in C99 as an unsigned integer. assigning non-value usually gives it a 1

	_Bool flag;
	
	Also includes <stdbool.h> which adds "bool", a macro for _Bool. also adds TRUE/FALSE

"Case"
	Much cleaner than cascading if statements

	switch (grade) {
	case 4: printf("Excellent");
		break;
	case 3: printf ("Good");
		break; } etc
	
	MUST be used with an integer expression in parentheses. Characters are integers. floats/strings
		are not.

	switch (expression) {
		case constant-expression : statements

"Constant Expression"
	cannot contain variables or function calls. n+10 does not qualify unless n is defined as a constant macro
	Only one constant expression can follow each case; however, multiple cases may precede statements
		case 4:  case 3: printf("This will run in both case 3 and 4");
		//notice they're both on the same line...often done to save space
	Cannot use range of values (use if instead). without default, will simply bypass switch if no matches

	Omiting break can sometimes be done to purposefully allow all cases below it to apply; usually, though,
		it's just a coding mistake. To make it clear this was an intentional big-brain move, use a comment:
		// FALL THROUGH //


#####################################
        "Chapter 6 - Loops" 
#####################################

"Controlling Expression"
    Every time a loop body is executed (an "iteration"), the controlling expression is evalued. If true, aka
        a non-zero value, the loop continues to execute. 

Three kinds of iteration statements (and other useful loop terminology):

"while"		Controlling Expression tested *before* the loop body is executed
"do"		Controlling Expression tested *after* the loop body is executed
"for"		Convenient for loops that increment/decrement using a counting variable (i++)

"break"		Jumps out of a loop and transfers control to the next statement after the loop
"continue"	Skips the rest of a loop iteration (like break, but restarts the loop)
"goto"		Jumps to any statement within a function (generally poor practice in real-world uses, so I hear)
"null"		Creates loops with empty bodies

"The While Statement"
    while	( expression )	statement

    while (i < n)	/* controlling expression */
	  i = i * 2  	/* loop daddy...I mean body*/

    Braces can create a single compound statement (of course)
    
	As the controlling expression is tested before, it's possible the loop may not be executed

	nonzero constants can create (purposefully) inifite loops:
	    while (1)
		/* a break, goto, or return is necessary to end the loop */

"%10d%10d"
    This trick can be used in place of tab to create pretty tables, since it is right-aligned as its a positive number

"The Do Statement"
	do	statement	while	( expression ) 

"The For Statement"
	for	( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )	statement
	
	- Any and all expressions may be omitted
    	for (; i > 0; --i)
	- When the 2nd expression is missing, it defaults to true, and must be terminated in another fashion (or run forever)!
		for (;;)
	- Comma expression in 1st/3rd allows for multiple initialization or increment steps. The first value is evaluated and discarded.
		Only the last value remains, and becomes the value of the entire expression
C99:
	- First expression can be replaced by a declaration (and is only visible *within* the loop!) Can declare multiple of same type
		for (int 1 = 0, j = 0; i < n; i++)

"Pre- vs Post-Increment"
	The book does not cover this, but listening to engineers speak about the language, pre-increment should always be used
	    over post-increment because post requires the i++ to be turned into i = i + 1 in memory. small difference that can add up!

"Break"
	- Transfers control just past the end of a loop (loop is ended)
	- Only jumps out of the innermost brackets in cases of nested statements
	- Can be used in Switch statements as well as loops

"Continue"
	- Transfers control just before the end of a loop (Meaning loop is evaluated again)

"Goto"
	- Transfers control to any statement in a function, provided that statement has a label
	- "label" is any identifier placed at the beginning of a statement with a colon (done:)
	- C99: Goto can't be used to bypass the declaration of a variable-length array
	- Should be used seldomly (if at all?). break, continue, return, exit are preferred
	- Can be used to exit a loop from within a subloop/switch statement

"Null"
	- Statement devoid of symbols except for a semicolon: for (;;), or a blank loop body



#####################################
      "Chapter 7 - Basic Types"
#####################################

"Two Integer Types: Integer and Floating"
  - Integer types are whole numbers, while floating can have a fractional
  - Integers: signed (postive/negative), or unsigned. Default Signed
  
  "Signed"
    The sign takes the left-most bit, reducing the available size.

  "Unsigned" 
    declared as unsigned. Useful for systems programming, and low-level, machine-dependent applications (see Chapter 20)

"Integer Sizes"
  Short Int -> Unsigned Short Int -> Int -> Unsigned Int -> Long Int -> Unsigned Long Int

  - Other combinations are synonyms for these six types. Can omit Int, as in Unsigned Short, or Long (best practice, some new languages require!)
  - Order doesn't matter; Unsigned Short Int is identical to Short Unsigned Int
  - Size is relative, and varies by compiler/computer. However, smaller sizes may not be larger than larger sizes. all three could be the same though!

"Integer Constants"
  - Numbers that appear in the text of a program. Not read, written, or computed. "Integer constants written in Decimal, Octal, or Hexadecimal"
  - Integers are always stored in binary, regardless of how we write them. You can even mix them.
  - Decimal cannot start with 0. Octal must start with 0. hex must start wiht 0x
  - Octal and hex are convenient for low-level programs ( see Chapter 20)
  - For extremely large constant, compilers can, in an emergency, attempt to use long or even unsigned long int.
  - To force a compiler to treat a constant as long, follow with the letter L (U for unsigned, can be either order): 15L	0377:	0xfffUL

"Integer Overflow"
  - When arithmetic performed on int values cannot fit into an int, overflow occurs. 
  - "Overflow of signed ints is undefined". Overflow of unsigned ints is defined as the number of bits used to store the result.

"Reading and Writing Integers"
  - in scanf, %d only works for signed integers. %u is used for unsigned, alongside %o (octal) and %x (hexadecimal)
  - Short Integer: %hd (think 'half'), or %ho, %hu, %hx
  - Long Integer: %ld	%lo  %lu  %lx
  - Long Long:    %lld	%llo %llu %llx

"Floating Point"
  Float			Single-precision
  Double		Double-Precision
  Long Double	Extended-precision

  - Float only suitable for precision to a ~one decimel point. double works for more programs. Long Double is rarely used. 
  - C does not guarantee nor state specific precision for *any* of these.
  - Constants stored as "double" by default, which are automatically converted to "float" when necessary
  - Override double default with letter F, ie 57.0F. 57.0L forces constantls into Long Double

"Reading and Writing Floating-Point"
  - Same as Integers, add l to the wrong, as in %lf, for scanf. do NOT add for printf, simply choose from %e %f %g to properly display
  - Long double gets a capital L: %Lf

"Chars"
  - C treats chars as small integers. C connects int and char so strongly, char const are actually int type rather than char! (just some fun trivia)
    i = 'a';	// i is now 97
    ch = 65;	// ch is now 'A'
	ch = ch + 1;// ch is now 'B'
  - Due to this, "Unsigned chars" exist. If you need to ensure it is one or the other, declare them as signed char, or unsigned char

"Escape Sequences"
  - Macros are recommended for escape characters, as they get a bit cryptic, per the book
  #define ESC '\33'		// ASCII escape character

"Character-Handling Functions"
  - Convert lower-case letters to upper-case with C's "toupper" library function:
  #include <ctype.h>
  ch = toupper(ch);

"Reading and Writing Characters using scanf and printf"
  - Use %c to denote a single character
  - scanf doesn't skip white-space before reading a character, so it will return a space as a character unless you use a space:
      scanf(" %c"
  - Since it doesn't skip white-space, you can use a simple loop to look for new-line character "\n" in an input line: 
	  do {
	  scanf(”%c”, &ch);
	  } while (ch != ’\n');

"Reading and Writing Characters using getchar and putchar"
  - getchar() and putchar() are functions to pull the value of a character
  - Often returns int type, not char. Does not skip whitespace (like scanf). Common function used:
  - Mixing getchar() and scanf often leads to poor results. Remember scanf will read, then put back whitespace, \n, etc.
      while ((getchar()) != '\n')
