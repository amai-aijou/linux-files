#     DevOps Continued Learning Path     #

##########################################

# Note: This is best viewed in vim, with ":set syntax=conf" configured

#########################
      "The Basics" 
 SysAdmin / DevOps / Dev
#########################

# Bare Bones Basics. Even if you know Linux already, you'll learn a lot. If you're as good as you think you are, you'll blow through it
  - Install Linux!
    > I suggest doing this in a Virtual Machine. Set up a free one like Virtualbox or VMWare (virtualbox is easier for beginners, IMO)
    > Brand New Users: Ubuntu 22.04
    > Experienced Users: RHEL 9.6
    > Stay away from cutting-edge releases, many utilities will have problems (*especially* Kubernetes)
  - vim & less (run vimtutor in CLI terminal)
  - Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator Cert (LFCS)
    # Even if you don't want the Cert, the classes will greatly speed along your familiarity with, and abillity to use, Linux
    > Complete Tecmint LFCS Classes 1-10, 14 at minimum
  - Review Github Bash Keyboard Shortcuts page
  - Learn Git basics. Optionally, set up Github, Gitlab, or similar code repository system
  - SSL Certificates


#########################
      "Kubernetes" 
         DevOps
#########################

# Suggest learning a bit of Docker, first, though a full class not necessary. Just install and play with it a bit in a VM!
  - Install K8s via kubeadm or, the hard way as linux processes (k8s.io docs)
    > My github has a step-by-step guide in Linux-Files/Cheatsheets/ubuntu-install-kubernetes
  - Complete Kodekloud Class - Mumshad CKA
    # Whether you plan to get the certificate or not, the CKA classes are by far and away the best way to learn Kubernetes
    > Kodekloud interactive Labs are of paramount importance (These are missing from linuxacademy etc)
    > Review preceding lesson for each test not passed 
  - Complete Kodekloud Class - CKA Ultimate Practice test (killer.sh)
  - Take Mumshad's first on kodekloud, then transition to killer.sh (free voucher to both tests with CKA exam)
  - CKA Certificate
    # If you've come this far, you may as well get it! It's ~$400, and opens the door to $70-170k jobs
    > If you already have CKS or another kube cert, take this while it's fresh in mind


#########################
   "SSO, SAML, OAuth" 
        SysAdmin
#########################
# This leans pretty heavy on the Enterprise side of things. Will look amazing on a resume, but it's not very useful for most people
  - Okta Learning (learning.okta)
  - Set up free non-production Okta SSO instance
  - Integrate with kubernetes application via SAML
  - Scripting

#########################
      "Scripting" 
 SysAdmin / DevOps / Dev
#########################

  - Advanced Bash Scripting (tldp Bash Guide)
  - sed/awk deeper dive, if not already done during LFCS (tldp micro-primer) (man -k awk)
  - Python (r/learnpython wiki)
  - Programming & Development


#########################
  "CI/CD & automation" 
         DevOps
#########################

  - Install CI/CD software and create a pipeline (jenkins)
  - Create a terraform script to automate the linux config customizations you made throughout this guide (terraform)


#########################
       "SSL/TLS" 
   SysAdmin / DevOps
#########################

# Set up enterprise-ready private Certificate Authority  (OpenSSL Certificate Authority - jamielinux)
  - Similar to quick CA guides, but creates persistence and organizational directories for historical storage
  - Use private CA to secure a live kubernetes application


#########################
     "Development" 
    Dev (of course!) 
#########################

# for non-dev paths, suggest learning C++/Java loops to understand how computer logic works, then deciding whether to continue
  - Let's Go! 
    > Book that teaches full-stack web development, including:
      * Postgres/MySQL/SQL
      * Golang
      * javascript
      * HTML/CSS
  - Go! Tour
    > go.dev
  - C Programming: A Modern Approach (K. N. King)
  - C++ for Programmers (Wiley)
  - Java (Java MOOC)
